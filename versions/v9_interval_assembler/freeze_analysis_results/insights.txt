FREEZE vs BACKGROUND ANALYSIS
================================================================================

1. Freeze has 64.2% lower average velocity than background
   Freeze: 40.45 px/s, Background: 112.87 px/s
   -> Suggested velocity threshold for freeze: < 92.22 px/s

2. Inter-mouse distance:
   Freeze: 0.00 px, Background: 0.00 px

3. Features with large effect sizes (|Cohen's d| > 0.5):
   - agent_velocity: Cohen's d = -1.265
   - target_velocity: Cohen's d = -1.265
   - overall_velocity: Cohen's d = -0.852

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS:
================================================================================

1. Add velocity gating in postprocessing:
   - Filter freeze predictions to require agent_velocity < 92.22 px/s
   - Consider target velocity as well

2. Increase freeze class weight in training loss
3. Add hard negative mining for background confusion
4. Consider adding explicit velocity features to model input
